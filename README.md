# Linux Authentication Lab

This project documents a professional-grade nested virtualization lab for Linux authentication using FreeIPA, Ubuntu clients, and Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVM), built inside a Hyper-V Virtual Machine (VM). The goal is to simulate real-world enterprise Linux support scenarios in preparation for roles such as Canonical's Linux Desktop & Devices Support Engineer.
